What is Devops Pipeline?
A Devops pipeline is set of automated processes and tools that the development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams implement to build, test, and deploy software faster and easier.


How do you make a DevOps pipeline?

Plan: It is the first and most important step in Devops Pipeline where  you have to decide your product's goals and determining the resources necessary to achieve those goals.

Code: It comes after where you will do code development and code review of your product

Build: In this step you will build the source code into one desired format, compile, test and deploy in a particular place of the infrastructure.

CI/CD: CI/CD stands for continuous integration (CI) and delivery (CD)  where it will check and verify the source code from Source Code Management and build it.

Test: Automatic tests ensure that no bugs will be implemented in production.

Release: The application code has passed the testing phase and now it is ready to be deployed.

Deploy: In this step, OPs team will deploy application from staging stage to production stage

Operate and Monitor: Here OPs team will operate and monitor the application and take action in any kind of failure.


What is Git in Devops?
Git is an open-source and distributed version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.

What is Github in Devops?
Github is git repository hosting service used for code sharing, bug tracking, feature request and much more.

What is difference between git and Github?
Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.

What are Tools and Libraries used for creating application in this course?
PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) for python programing language.
Flask is a python web framework.
HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.
CSS is a style sheet language use to style a HTML document.
SQLAlchemy is an open-source SQL toolkit and object-relational mapper which gives full power and flexibility of SQL.
Selenium is used to automate web browser interaction.
Pytest is unit testing framework that allows users to write test codes.
Ngrok allows to expose a web server running on your local machine to the internet.

What is Github Action in Devops?
Github Action enables you to include Continues Integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) capabilities and many other features directly in your repository.

What is Docker in Devops?
Docker is an open source containerization platform enables developers to package applications into containers.

Why use Docker?
Docker solved the 'it works on my machine' headache by making applications platform independent. With Docker you can simply build, ship and run your application

What is Docker Hub?
Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository for finding and sharing container images with your team.

What are alternatives of Docker Hub?
AWS ECR, Azure Container Registry, Quay are the alternatives of Docker Hub.

What is Kubernetes in Devops?
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Then you can come back here to download the repository. This repository contains the code that we develop in each section of the course. If you are familiar with Git, you can use Git to download it. Otherwise, you can download it as a zip file:

Next, start taking the course at the beginning! You can use the downloaded code files to support you while you go through the course.

I also strongly recommend you code while you take the course. A good strategy is:

Watch the video intently, optionally while taking notes.
Watch again, more quickly, while typing the code together with me.
Once you're done with the video, play about with the code. Make changes, break things, then fix them, and try to thoroughly understand everything the code does.
If you do this for the entire course, I guarantee you will learn how to make REST APIs using Flask and Python well and quickly.
